            <p><strong>"The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want."</strong></p>
            <p>He was a shepherd boy who defeated a giant with a single stone. He was a warrior king who united a
                nation. He was a poet who wrote songs that we still sing 3,000 years later.</p>
            <p>But he was also a man who fell hard into sin. Yet, his greatness wasn't in his perfection, but in his
                repentance. He shows us that a "Man after God's own heart" isn't someone who never messes up, but
                someone who always runs back to the Father.</p>
