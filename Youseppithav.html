    <p>
      We call him <strong>Youseppithav</strong>. Not a quiet carpenter in the corner. God put Jesus and Amma in his hands — a mission greater than the choirs of angels. The Church honors him above all, because even heaven saw the weight he bore.
    </p>

    <p>
      His <strong>Chaste Heart</strong> is fire and shield. Calm, steady, unshakable. Lean on it, and you step into the same safety Mary and Jesus knew.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jesus called him <strong>Abba</strong>. The Son trusted him as father. We do too. We run to him, we follow him, we lean on his calm when our work overwhelms us.
    </p>

    <p>
      He <strong>works</strong>. Every nail, every small task, every quiet day at the bench — he shows us how labor becomes prayer. Depending on him as a worker shapes our hands and hearts to serve faithfully, without losing peace.
