    <p>We call him <strong>St. John the Baptist</strong>. Even in his mother’s womb, he <strong>leapt at the presence of
        Jesus</strong> — a divine recognition of the Messiah. <strong>Fear never held him</strong>, even facing death;
      his <strong>courage and devotion were absolute</strong>.</p>

    <p>John’s mission was clear: <strong>to point everyone to Jesus</strong>, <strong>to prepare the way for
        Him</strong>. He lived <strong>boldly and simply</strong>, showing us that <strong>true greatness is in serving
        God</strong> and making His name known. <strong>Jesus Himself said there was no one greater than John</strong>,
      yet he <strong>humbly pointed beyond himself to the One who must increase</strong>.</p>

    <p>His life reminds us to <strong>let go of fear</strong>, <strong>embrace our mission</strong>, and always
      <strong>direct hearts toward Jesus</strong>. <strong>Leaning on his example</strong> helps us live with
      <strong>courage, purpose, and devotion</strong>, even when life overwhelms us.</p>
